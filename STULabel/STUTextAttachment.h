/// An immutable drawable object (e.g. an image) that should be displayed inline (like a text glyph)

///
/// `STUTextAttachment` instances are meant to be used as values for the
/// `STUAttachmentAttributeName` (`.stuAttachment`) key in `NSAttributedString` instances
/// that are displayed in `STULabel` views or rendered with the help of `STUTextFrame` instances.
///
/// `STUTextAttachment` is a replacement for `NSTextAttachment` that is more suitable for the
/// purposes of this library.
///
/// `STUTextAttachment` is meant to be used as a base class, e.g. for `STUImageTextAttachment`,
/// but you can also use it directly in order to create blank spaces in the running text, so that
/// you can e.g. place subviews over their locations.
///
/// @note
///  Subclasses of `STUTextAttachment` are expected to be immutable and the `drawInContext:` method
///  must be thread-safe.
///
/// In attributed strings an attachment should normally only be set as an attribute on a U+FFFC
/// character (`NSAttachmentCharacter`). When it is set on multiple characters, it will be drawn
/// multiple times.
///
/// CoreText does not support attachments directly and requires a `CTRunDelegate` attribute for
/// every attachment in order to compute correct typographic bounds.
///
/// In Objective-C code you can use the `+[NSAttributedString stu_newWithSTUAttachment:]` factory
/// method to conveniently create an attributed string containing a single U+FFFC character with
/// the specified attachment and an appropriate run delegate as attributes. In Swift code this
/// factory method is available as the initializer
/// `NSAttributedString(stu_attachment: myAttachment)`.
///
/// `CTRunDelegate` instances do not support `NSCoding`. Hence, if you need to archive an
/// `NSAttributedString` containing run delegates, you first need to remove the run delegates,
/// e.g. by using the `-[NSAttributedString stu_attributedStringByRemovingCTRunDelegates]`
/// method. To add back missing run delegates for `STUTextAttachment` instances you can use the
/// `-[NSAttributedString stu_attributedStringByAddingCTRunDelegatesForSTUAttachments]` method.
///
/// You can make a `STUTextAttachment` value individually accessible in a `STULabel` by setting
/// `isAccessibilityElement` to true and defining appropriate accessibility properties. However,
/// specifying an appropriate `stringRepresentation` when constructing the attachment is often
/// already enough to ensure good accessibility.
///
/// Equality for `STUTextAttachment` instances is defined as pointer equality.
